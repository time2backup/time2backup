If you have enabled recurrent backups, you just have to wait until backup is finished
(you will have a notification popup on your desktop).

## Frequently Asked Questions

If you don't find answer to your question, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/time2backup/time2backup/issues)

### time2backup is stuck with message "a backup is already running"
Sometimes, if time2backup was killed by force, a lock file may stay.
To fix this, run the backup command with `--force-unlock` option.

### How do I set up excludes in a multi-sources setup?
If you backup multiple sources, excluded files are applying globally.
But if you want to set custom excludes for a directory, create a file named `.rsyncingnore` at the root of your source directory
and fill it with common exclude syntax.

Note: This will not work for remote sources.

Remember that you can also create multiple time2backup configs and call them with `time2backup -c path/to/config`.
