########################
#  BACKUP DESTINATION  #
########################

# Destination path for backups.
# You can use relative or absolute paths. You can also use the ~ symbol.
# If you use relative paths, it will be relative to the path of the script.
# This value cannot be unset. If you use the configuration wizard,
# it will be set with your choice.
# No default value; this field is mandatory.
destination = ""

# Create backup destination subdirectories like $destination/backups/$(hostname)/
# Set it to false to put the backups at the root of the $destination path
# Default: true
#destination_subdirectories = true

# Test if destination has enough space before backup.
# Put it to false ONLY if you are sure of your destination and you want to
# run backup more quickly. If there is not enough space, your backup will fail.
# Default: true
#test_destination = true


####################
#  BACKUPS ROTATE  #
####################

# Number of old backups to keep.
# Use 0 to keep only a mirror of your current files (do not keep old versions).
# Use -1 for unlimited backups (keep revisions until disk is full).
# Default value: -1
#keep_limit = -1

# Clean old backups when destination disk is full.
# When your backup destination disk is full, time2backup will delete oldest backups
# until there is space enough on the disk to perform backup.
# Default value: true
#clean_old_backups = true

# When cleaning old backups, you can set a limit to always keep at least the
# last N backups (current backup not included).
# Default value: 0

#  Run a backup at least one time per hour/day/week/month.        #
#  If you want to use planned backups, please create rules in     #
#  your crontab (run crontab -e to edit).                         #
#  e.g. To backup every Sunday at 23:59, add the following line:  #
#       59 23 * * sun   /path/to/time2backup.sh backup            #
